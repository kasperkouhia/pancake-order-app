# Pancake Order App

> Concept for the UI and basic functionality of a pancake ordering and order managing website.

## Overview

This is a React app consisting of two pages: one for ordering, and another for managing orders. All instances of the pages are built mobile-first and are responsive in design.

Consider everything here to be **very** much a work-in-progress. Many improvements can still be made.
